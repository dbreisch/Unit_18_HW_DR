      <h3>User Research</h3>
      <p>I'm a baller researcher. Having worked in operations, I'm comfortable manipulating qualitative and quantitative
        data. and allowing them to drive decision-making. I conduct interviews and sift through the data to create
        personas, journeys and more.

      <h3>User Interface Design</h3>
      <p>I bring a practical and professional approach to UI design. I work from the ground up, starting with sketches
        and lo-fi wireframes. From there I think deeply but swiftly about what components and local styles will
        facilitate my team's work. And I iterate all the way through the hi-fi.

      <h3>Web Development</h3>
      <p>A solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and experience with Bootstrap helps me communicate and
        empathize with developers. I believe the UX Design process is a two-way street.

        <h3>WMATA</h3>
        <p>WMATA's site feels stuffy and misses a lot of what makes DC unique, like the Metro stations' brutal-futurist architecture. Incorporating it and making the website more easily navigable was this project's goal.
